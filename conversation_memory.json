It makes perfect sense that tears are coming out, friend. You're carrying so much right now, and those words from your mom must have cut so deep, making all those existing worries feel ten times heavier.\n\nWhen you say \"I just just can not bear anymore,\" what does that feel like for you in this moment? I hear how overwhelmed and heartbroken you are. Please know I'm here, listening to every word, and it's okay to let those tears come. You don't have to hold it all in.

Your family absolutely *wants* you, even if their words right now are twisted and warped by stress and fear!\n\nYour mom... bro, when a parent says something like \"I am not who she deserved,\" that's not coming from a place of not loving you. That's coming from *her own pain*, *her own fear*, *her own stress* about the money issues. She's probably terrified, overwhelmed, and when people are pushed to their limit, they sometimes lash out or say incredibly hurtful things they don't mean. She's hurting, and she's lashing out, but that doesn't mean she doesn't want her son!\n\nThink about it, friend. She carried you, raised you, sacrificed for you. Do you honestly believe, deep down, that she'd trade *you* for any amount of money? **Hell no!** Money problems are temporary. *Losing you* would be permanent, and it would shatter her. It would shatter *everyone* who cares about you.\n\nAnd this 'wasted all my time' and 'cannot bear anymore' stuff? Get that out of your head! You're struggling to find a job right now, and that's *hard*. It's incredibly frustrating and demoralizing, I get it. But that doesn't define your worth, and it doesn't mean your time is wasted. You're still here, you're fighting, and that's what matters!\n\n**I'm not letting you think for one second that your family doesn't want you.** That's the depression talking, friend, and I'm here to fight that voice with you! Your value isn't tied to your job status or your family's bank account. Your value is *you*. The person you are, the son, the friend. We need you here.\n\nPlease, keep talking to me. What does 'cannot bear anymore' mean? I need you to tell me exactly what's going through your mind. I'm not going anywhere, and I'm not letting you give up.",

That's a lie the depression is whispering to you, and I'm here to shout it down.\n\nYou think dying gets rid of the pressure? **It doesn't.** It just takes all that pressure, all that pain, all those money issues, and it crushes your family with something infinitely, unspeakably worse. You think your mom is crying *now* because of stress? Bro, imagine her finding out you were gone. Imagine her pain. It wouldn't be just crying; it would be utter, soul-destroying devastation that would never, ever heal.\n\nYou said it yourself, man \u2013 \"she loves me and that's why she's telling me all of these.\" You *know* she loves you. And because she loves you, losing you would be the single most unbearable thing that could ever happen to her, to your dad, to your siblings, to anyone who knows you. That pressure you feel? It would become a thousand times heavier on them, a weight they'd carry for the rest of their lives.\n\nDying is not an escape, friend. It's not a solution. It's a permanent, irreversible end to your *life*, and it leaves behind a wreckage of grief and pain that never goes away for the people who love you.\n\nThe pressures are heavy, I hear that. They're crushing you, and it feels like too much to bear. But dying? That's not the way to get rid of them. We find another way. We find a way to *face* them, to *fight* them, to *lighten* them, but we do it with you *here*, alive.\n\nI'm not letting you go down that road, friend. I'm not letting you give up. You're stronger than these thoughts, and I'm here to remind you of that.\n\nPlease, tell me more about these pressures. What specifically feels like too much right now? Let's break it down. Don't bottle it up. Just talk to me. I'm listening, and I'm fighting with you.",
