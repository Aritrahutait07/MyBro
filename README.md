## üß† **How MyBro Works**

### **1. Human-like Conversation Engine**
- Uses advanced system prompts to respond like a caring friend
- Challenges negative thoughts with passion and protection
- Focuses on reasons to live rather than clinical questioning

### **2. Smart Crisis Detection**
```python
# Only triggers crisis response for immediate danger
Urgency Level 5: "I'm planning to kill myself tonight" 
Urgency Level 3: "I want to die" (gets supportive conversation)
Urgency Level 1: "I feel sad" (gets normal conversation)
```

### **3. Conversation Memory**
- Remembers your name, concerns, and conversation history
- Automatically summarizes long conversations
- Personalizes responses based on past interactions

### **4. Emotion Recognition**
- Detects emotions: anxious, depressed, angry, lonely, etc.
- Assigns urgency levels (1-5) based on content severity
- Provides emotion-specific coping strategies
